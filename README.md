# Hand-digit-recognition-MNIST-dataset

This is a Deep learning project which recognizes hand written digits images present in the MNIST dataset. It is a deep neural network consisting of a hidden layer which uses ReLU as an activation function and an output layer to generate the final output. The network is trained and tested on Apple's M1 Metal Performance Shaders (mps) GPU using PyTorch framework. This model is able to achieve an accuracy of 96.5% on the MNIST test dataset.
